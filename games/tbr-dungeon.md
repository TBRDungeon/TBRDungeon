The TBR Dungeon is a Phaser 3 board game where you navigate a procedurally generated dungeon filled with books. Each room presents choices that shape your reading list, challenging you to balance genres, page counts, and your ever-growing to-be-read pile.

## Features

- **Dungeon crawling meets reading** — explore rooms, collect books, build your TBR
- **Strategic choices** — every door leads to a different genre or challenge
- **Solo or with friends** — play alone or compete to build the best list
- **Quick sessions** — a full game takes 15-20 minutes
