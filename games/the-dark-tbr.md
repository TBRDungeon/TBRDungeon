The Dark TBR takes the book-list-building concept into darker territory. Face tougher decisions, riskier rewards, and a more punishing path as you curate a reading list under pressure. Not every book makes the cut — and the ones that don't may come back to haunt you.

## Features

- **High-stakes curation** — every choice has consequences
- **Dark fantasy aesthetic** — moody visuals and atmospheric design
- **Risk vs. reward** — push your luck or play it safe
- **Replayable** — procedural elements keep each session fresh
